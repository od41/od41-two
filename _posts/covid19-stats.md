## Summary

This project visualises the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria.

## Why

Data can be abstract, and if not presented visually can make people unable to grasp viscerally. The right visualisations helps people understand how COVID-19 is spreading in their country and guides them to appropriate precautions to be safe. 

## Usage

You can view the current state of the COVID-19 spread (updated daily) with `Current Infections`. Also, view the infections through time, from day 1 to current day with `Infection Spread`.

## Data Source

This project uses the free [covid19api.com](https://covid19api.com/) developed by Kyle Redelinghuys, which sources data from the [John Hopkins CSSE Data Repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
