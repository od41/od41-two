## Ambition
Drumbeat was reworking and optimizing all aspects of their product’s experience. The mobile app, marketing website, visual identity, copy writing and admin dashboard.

## Approach
I was responsible for research, prototyping and UI design of the mobile app. Then, handover design assets to the Drumbeat team.

I began by conducting a usability test/interview session with four users to uncover any UX issues with the existing mobile app.

After the tests and analysis of the data, I uncovered aesthetics, no clear value proposition for new users and ambiguous labeling.

## Process
Research > Information Architecture > Prototype > Iteration > Handover

## Information Architecture
I developed the wireﬂow that explained the new ﬂow for a user in the app.

## Solution

### Value Proposition (Show Don't Tell)
The “why” of the app wasn’t clear. New users wanted to understand how to begin using the app.

### ON BOARDING
Guide new users to the “aha” moment for the app. New users had to:

* Set up their proﬁles.
* Engage with activity from existing users which shows the user what’s possible.
* Existing users can be followed so as to see available content when using the app.
