## Ambition
A portal for technical and service support contractors to interface with the internal ticketing system(s); and also as a performance management tool.

## Approach
This project had a narrow window for any intentional UX design to be incorporated (less than 2 weeks). I didnâ€™t want to reinvent the wheel. I used the prepared user flow and SRS (software requirement spec) to quickly search for already existing designs, assessing them for fit.
