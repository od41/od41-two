## Ambition
Drumbeat App is a location based messaging service. They had launched the first version of their app on the PlayStore. They wanted a redesign of the app experience.

## Approach
For this redesign, I was responsible for research, prototyping and UI design.

I began by conducting a usability test/interview session with four users to uncover any UX issues with the existing mobile app. The findings from these interviews led me to redesign the user flow, define a clear value proposition with an onboarding flow and fix confusing labels.

## Process

## Information Architecture
I developed the wireﬂow that explained the new ﬂow for a user in the app.

## Final Solution

### Value Proposition (Show Don't Tell)
The “why” of the app wasn’t clear. New users wanted to understand how to begin using the app.

### Onboarding
Guide new users to the “aha” moment for the app. New users had to:

* Set up their proﬁles.
* Engage with activity from existing users which shows the user what’s possible.
* Existing users can be followed so as to see available content when using the app.

## Learnings and Insight
This project concluded with sharing a design spec with Drumbeat App’s development team via Zeplin. There were a few insights that I took out of it

1. ### Talking to users uncovers your bias
During the interviews, some users observations were surprising. I didn't notice that when I was on my own. It reinforced the value of talking to users.

This will be valuable in future projects.
