## Goal
iEventify saves event organisers the hassle of distributing tickets for their events. My role was to design a prototype for version 1 of the product. 

## Approach and Constraints
I was responsible for the UX, and UI for this part of the project. Also, I had 2 weeks to go from wireframe to high fidelity prototype.

All research was done quickly to augment the data provided in documentation because of the limited time to execute.

## Research
I did quick research; competitive analyses of event related products, streaming platforms and social media apps like Twitch, Eventbrite, Meetup.com, Ticketmaster etc.

There were 2 broad classes of users for this platform
  * Event Goers
  * Event Organisers

### Event Goers
My intuition (after looking at similar products) was that event goers visit the platform from a promoters ticket purchase link, at that point, they wanted to learn about that particular event and then purchase tickets.

### Event Organisers
Event organisers had different objectives:
  * Easily create & setup events
  * Tickets distribution and sales
  * Data analytics on event registration and ticket sales
  * Event promotion to Event Goers
